This is an R Shiny app that runs a series of regressions to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects related to several variables as described in [MLMExperiment_analysis.md](https://github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/blob/main/MLMExperiment_analysis.md#heterogeneous-treatment-effects).

The app takes a variable from a list as input and runs the regressions using that variable. 
The app then displays a formatted table of results from the regression estimations.

This app is hosted at https://uncle-pasta.shinyapps.io/heterogeneous-app/
