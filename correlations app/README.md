This is an R Shiny app that creates a correlation table from data as described in [MLMExperiment_sumstats.md](https://github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/blob/main/MLMExperiment_sumstats.md#correlations).

The app takes a p-value cutoff between 0 and 1 and returns only the correlations that have a p-value lower than that cutoff.

This app is hosted at https://uncle-pasta.shinyapps.io/correlations-app/
