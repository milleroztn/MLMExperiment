MLM Disclosure Experiment
================
Austin Miller

# Introduction
Here you can access the documents I created to present and discuss the R scripts that I wrote to analyze the data generated by a recent Amazon Mechanical Turk survey experiment. The goal of the analysis is to assess the impact of voluntary income disclosures in MLM marketing materials on consumer interest and earnings expectations. All participants were introduced to an MLM opportunity using marketing materials from the website of an actual MLM firm. The control group did not receive any income disclosure information; treatment group 1 received the income disclosure document created by the MLM firm itself; and treatment group 2 received an augmented form of the firmâ€™s income disclosure information that included a graph and presented how many participants in the firm actually earned zero dollars. The analysis from this experiment was recently published for publication as ["Income Disclosure and Consumer Judgment in a Multi-level Marketing Experiment"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joca.12492) in Journal of Consumer Affairs.

This document also employs R Shiny apps,

This final script contains all of the regression analysis that supports the final paper. This includes:

*  [Main Model of the Income Disclosure Effects on All Dependent Variables](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_analysis#income-disclosure-effects-on-all-dependent-variables)
*  [A Graphical Justification for Logarithmic Transforms of Dependent Variables](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_analysis#justification-for-logarithmic-transforms)
*  [Alternative Interest Specifications](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_analysis#alternative-interest-specifications)

# Data Cleaning
[MLM Experiment- Data Cleaning](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_data)

The first script cleans the raw data and prepares it for analysis. This document includes:

*  [a description of all data transformations](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_data#read-and-format-data)
*  [a discussion about possible errors in the responses](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_data#order-of-earnings-questions)
*  [a description of dropped observations](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_data#dropped-observations)

Raw and clean data files are available here: [github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/data](https://github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/data)

# Graphs
[MLM Experiment- Graphs](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_graphs)

The next script generates and discusses graphs from the data, including:

*  [Distributions of Key Variables, by Treatment Group](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_graphs#distributions-of-key-variables-by-treatment-group)
*  [Correlations of Interest v. Earnings](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_graphs#correlation-of-interest-v-earnings)
*  [Correlations of Better-than-average Effect with Interest and Earnings](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_graphs#better-than-average-effect)

Graph files are available here: [github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/graphs](https://github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/graphs)

# Summary Tables
[MLM Experiment- Summary Tables](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_sumstats)

This script generates and discusses summary tables from the data, including:

*  [Summary Statistics for All Variables](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_sumstats#summary-statistics-for-all-variables)
*  [Significant Correlations with Dependent Variables](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_sumstats#correlations)
*  [Distributions of Dependent Variables Across Treatment Groups](https://milleroztn.github.io/MLMExperiment/MLMExperiment_sumstats#distributions-of-dependent-variables-across-treatment-groups), including tests for differences in means, medians, and variances

The generated \*.csv files from this script are available here: [github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/descriptive](https://github.com/milleroztn/MLMExperiment/tree/main/descriptive)
